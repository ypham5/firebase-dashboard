How to read data from the real time database and render the vacations in the browser. Your template should display the image the city and present the user with options to remove or edit the vacation rental property.


 
### 1. Make Sure You Have Data
Make sure you have at least 4 data sets in the RTD (real time database). We will use this data in the read.html page to present the data using a render function.


### 2. Code
The code for the example is in the snippets folder ```read.md```.  
You still have to create a display component for a vacation rental and add the styles.
